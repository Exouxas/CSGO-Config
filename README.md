# CSGO-Config
Config setup for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Applying the script manually:
1. Copy these files into "steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\CustomFolderName"
2. Launch CS:GO and open the console
3. Type in "exec CustomFolderName/Setup"

Whenever you start a match for the first time, you can press the home button to re-apply the settings. This is mainly for the aliases until I've figured out an easier way to do it.
